     <p>Ive done a lot of volunteering and some competition this year which were really fun. I learned a lot from them because before that I didn't know anything about computers or anything. I also got into a school called Academis of Loudoun which I take a Cybersecurit class for the entire day and I will be going back for my last year of high school. Here are a couple things that I have done through the years.</p>
     <div></div>
     <h1>Academies of Loudoun</h1>
     <p>This is another school I go to while also going to my home school. I go there to take my Cybersecurity class which I work on building PCs, learning about how to make a computer safer, etc. This year we had to do a group project where we build a machine or device which can help the work in some way. My team and I built a product which can detect the type of trash and tell us where to properly dispose it. We are called CodeGreen. We use a AWS Deeplens Camera to help detect the product and to do that we teach the Camera how to detect the different products. This is still a work in progress though. </p>
     <h1>MetroHacks Women Competition</h1>
     <p1>
         Me and my team who were at the MetroHacks Competition, this year, won 3rd place for best environmental hack. We created a website which helps others know when a storm is coming, where a shelter is located, and tips on what to do when you are in any natural disaster situation. We also programed a mini game so that people can educate themselves in a fun way.
     </p1>

     <h1>Cyberpatriot</h1>
     <p>At my school, Academies of Loudoun, my team and I competed several rounds and ended up in the silver group for the final. Even tho it was my first year doing it, I think I did a pretty good job.</p>
     <div></div>
     <h1>Volunteering</h1>
     <p>I have volunteered at the Gum Spring Library since 6th grade and recently volunteered at NOVA Podiatry and Wound Care Center which I got to job shadow. I saw some pretty cool gruesome stuff, but it was fun to experience and learn about it while volunteering there.</p>
     <div></div>
    <h1>Girls JV Lacrosse Manager</h1>
    <p>During my sophmore year of high school, I volunteered to manage the Girls Junior Varsity Lacrosse team for the season. This taught me a lot of leadership skill as well as readiness skills.</p>
